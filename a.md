She is more smarter than him
He don't know nothing about it
We was watching a movie last night
She don't like coffee.  
Me and my friend is going to the park.  
He go to school every day.  
I have went to the store yesterday.  
The dog wag its tail happily.  
She sings good.  
There is many apples in the basket.
